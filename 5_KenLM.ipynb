    "# 5) KenLM with Kneser-Ney Smoothing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements a language model using KenLM, an optimized n-gram library with Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Description:**\n",
    "- Uses KenLM library (highly optimized C++ implementation)\n",
    "- Modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (state-of-the-art for n-grams)\n",
    "- Supports 5-gram with proper backoff\n",
    "- Much faster and more memory-efficient than pure Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Performance:**\n",
    "- 10K data: ~25-30% accuracy\n",
    "- 100K data: ~45-50% accuracy\n",
    "- 1M data: ~55-60% accuracy\n",
    "- Full (3.8M) data: ~58-65% accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why KenLM?**\n",
    "- Modified Kneser-Ney > Simple MLE (our previous models)\n",
    "- Handles unseen n-grams much better\n",
    "- Industry standard for n-gram models\n",
    "- Used in Moses MT, speech recognition, etc."
